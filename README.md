# PintOS

PintOS is an educational operating system framework for x86 architecture. It's designed to help students understand operating system concepts through hands-on implementation.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into multiple phases:

- **Phase 1**: Basic kernel and thread management
- **Phase 2**: User programs and system calls

Each phase contains:
- `src/` - Source code for implementation
- `tests/` - Test cases to verify functionality
- `specs/` - Detailed specifications and requirements
- `doc/` - Documentation and references
- `guides/` - Implementation guides and tutorials
- `resources/` - Additional resources and materials

## Installation

You can install PintOS using either Docker or direct installation:

1. **Docker Installation**:
   See [Installation_with_docker.md](phase1/Installation_with_docker.md) for Docker-based setup.

2. **Manual Installation**:
   See [Installation.md](phase1/Installation.md) for traditional setup instructions.

## Building and Running

To build the project:

```bash
cd phase1  # or phase2
make
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `doc/` directory of each phase. Key documents include:
- Project specifications
- Debugging guides
- Development references
- File system documentation
